Sound Defender was created for the UNC Computer Science event [Maze Day](http://www.cs.unc.edu/cms/outreach/maze-day). During this event, blind and visually-impaired children come to the department and play student-developed video games. This is a great event, because there are virtually no video games designed for visually impaired individuals out there.

Sound Defender is a "tower defense game" of sorts in which the player must shoot at incoming enemies before they reach the player. The game makes use of a spacial sound library to play sounds of incoming enemies relative to the player's current position. In this way the player must rotate the turret until aligned with the enemy (using only sound) before firing the laser.

Although there is a visual component to the game, players can elect to "turn off the lights" (black  out the screen) in order to level the playing field between sighted and blind players.

There is a high scores table, which gets read aloud to the player at the end of the game (during Maze Day the high scores became quite competitive).

## Objective

Sound Defender is a "tower defense game" of sorts in which the player must shoot at incoming enemies before they reach the player. The game makes use of a spacial sound library to play sounds of incoming enemies relative to the player's current position. In this way the player must rotate the turret until aligned with the enemy (using only sound) before firing the laser.
